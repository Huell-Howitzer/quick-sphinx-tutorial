What is Sphinx?
===============

From sphinx-doc.org:

* Sphinx is a tool that makes it easy to create intelligent and beautiful documentation.
* It was originally created for the new Python documentation, and it has excellent facilities for the documentation of Python projects, but C/C++ is already supported as well.

Sphinx Philosophy
-----------------

`Sphinx`_ is what is called a documentation generator.
This means that it takes a bunch of source files in plain text,
and generates a bunch of other awesome things, mainly HTML.
For our use case you can think of it as a program that takes in plain text
files in `reStructuredText`_ format, and outputs HTML.

::

    reST -> Sphinx -> HTML

So as a user of Sphinx, your main job will be writing these text files.
This means that you should be minimally familiar with `reStructuredText`_ as
a language.
It's similar to Markdown in a lot of ways,
if you are already familiar with Markdown.
