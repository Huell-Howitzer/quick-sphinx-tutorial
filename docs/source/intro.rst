What is Sphinx?
===============

From http://sphinx-doc.org:

* Sphinx is a tool that makes it *easy to create intelligent and beautiful documentation*.
* It was *originally created for the new Python documentation*, and it has excellent facilities for the documentation of Python projects, but C/C++ is already supported as well.

.. warning:: ... a great tool that actually makes programmers **want** to write documentation!

Sphinx Philosophy
-----------------

`Sphinx`_ is a documentation generator.
This means that is takes in plain text
files in `reStructuredText`_ format, and outputs HTML.

::

    reST -> Sphinx -> HTML

So as a user of Sphinx, your main job will be writing these text files with `reStructuredText`_.
`reStructuredText`_ is similar to Markdown in a lot of ways,

Sphinx Advantages
-----------------

* Documents written in plain text files.
* Output formats will be generated by Sphinx: HTML, PDF, eBook.
* Markup language used (ReST) is similar to Wiki languages (Markdown, Textile, ...).
* Version control (GitHub) can be used for collaborative work.
* The documentation is part of the code.
