Using reStructuredText
=======================

After using ``sphinx-quickstart`` you have the ``index.rst`` file which contains the content:

.. literalinclude:: index.rst
    :language: rst

You can create other files here for additional documentation. Once you have created them, then you can include them in the table of contents in index.rst.

.. note::
   
   Use the RST and Sphinx cheat sheet to help remember the syntax.

reStructuredText (ReST) Syntax
------------------------------

If you need a reference to ReST syntax and markup for Sphinx, `this is a tutorial <http://thomas-cokelaer.info/tutorials/sphinx/rest_syntax.html>`_ that explains it very well.


Play with RST
-------------

RST takes a bit of practice to wrap your head around.
Go over to http://rst.ninjs.org,
which is a live preview.

.. note:: Use the :doc:`cheatsheet` for lots more ideas!

Looking for some ideas of what the syntax contains?
The :ref:`rst-primer` in the Sphinx docs is a great place to start.
