Using reStructuredText
=======================

After using ``sphinx-quickstart`` you have the ``index.rst`` file which contains the content:

.. literalinclude:: index.rst
    :language: rst

You can create other files here for additional documentation. Once you have created them, then you can include them in the table of contents in index.rst.

reStructuredText (ReST) Syntax
------------------------------

If you need a reference to ReST syntax and markup for Sphinx, `this is a tutorial <http://thomas-cokelaer.info/tutorials/sphinx/rest_syntax.html>`_ that explains it very well.
