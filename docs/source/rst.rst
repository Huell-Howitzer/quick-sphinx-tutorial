Using reStructuredText
=======================

After using ``sphinx-quickstart`` you have the ``index.rst`` file which contains the content:

.. literalinclude:: index.rst
    :language: rst

You can create other files here for additional documentation. Once you have created them, then you can include them in the table of contents in index.rst.


Play with reStructuredText (ReST) Syntax
----------------------------------------

ReST takes a bit of practice to wrap your head around. Go over to http://rst.ninjs.org, which is a live preview.

Looking for some ideas of what the syntax contains?
The :ref:`rst-primer` in the Sphinx docs is a great place to start.

.. note:: Use the `cheatsheet`_ for lots more ideas!
