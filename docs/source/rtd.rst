ReadTheDocs and Sphinx
======================

The powerful and popular Read the Docs service
lets you configure your GitHub repository
so that every time you push a new version of your software,
the documentation gets automatically rebuilt
and made available at:

https://readthedocs.org/projects/<project-name>/

Read the Docs also supports custom host names
if you want your documentation to appear beneath your own
project sub-domain.
More information is available at:

https://readthedocs.org/


Last but not least,
once you've written your documentation you have to put it somewhere for the world to see!
Read the Docs makes this quite simple,
and is free for all open source projects.

* Register for an account at http://readthedocs.org
* Click the *Import Project* button
* Add the URL for a specific repository you want to build docs for
* Sit back and have a drink while Read the Docs does the rest.

It will:

* Pull down your code
* Install your ``requirements.txt``
* Build HTML, PDF, and ePub of your docs
* Serve it up online at ``http://<projectname>.readthedocs.org``

Read the Docs Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Read the Docs gives you a number of additional features.

* You can add Versions to your project for each tag & branch.
* You can alerts for when your doc build fails
* You can search across the full set of docs

Let's see what that looks like in practice.
